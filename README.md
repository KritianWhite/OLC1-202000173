A customer has asked you for a Pseudo-Parser so that new staff who do not know the languages of Python and Golang, can apply their knowledge in pseudocode and using an application, translate this code and see how the different syntaxes of each of the languages behave since for each one there are different characteristics, therefore, you are requested from your knowledge in compilers to make an implementation of the first 2 phases of a compiler and run a translation with the input of pseudocode to Python and Golang. In addition you should be able to visualize the flowchart resulting from the input, for this you should use the JFLEX and CUP tools and implement your solution in the JAVA programming language.  

The solution must be intuitive and easy to use, showing the results and reports, The solution must be intuitive and easy to use, showing the results and reports, both errors and the flowchart, as structured as possible, and as an additional part of the application the client requests that the parse tree can be visualized and exported to PDF, as well as the translations and other reports.
